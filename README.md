# Game-Mod-Q4
IT266 Quake 4 Project. Aspects of Kingdom Hearts meet Quake 4

The way to test this mod is by creating a folder for the mod in the directory for Quake 4. You can then simply down this code, extract it into the folder, and then run the mod 
by either going to Quake 4 and loading the mod or following the desktop shortcut. The changes are listed under specific deliverables. 

The common deliverables are as follows:
1) A desktop shortcut to automatically launch your mod 
/* This was done by creating a shorcut on my desktop and then changing the target to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake 4\Quake4.exe" +set fs_game omicron +disconnect */
3) A README.md file in your github repository explaining what your mod is, what has been, and HOW to test each deliverable /* duh this is github */
4) Modified Main Menu /* made the main menu color themes to match that of Kingdom Hearts 30th anniversary poster */
5) Modified Heads Up Display (HUD) to reflect a key feature of your mod
6) An In-Game Help screen explaining your mod changes

The specific deliverables are: 
1) a couple of companion AI's (goofy&donald or sora)
2) fantasy combat. replace weapons with keyblades and spells.
3) experience gaining (dnd style)
4) addition of equipable items (5ish)
5) make encounters go to separate screen and then when done go back to normal gameplay. 

/* The names of the weapons can be changed in the definition files. Changing inv_name will change the name to whatever you want it to be */
